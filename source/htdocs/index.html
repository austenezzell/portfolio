                  <p>The World's Game Project started as an excuse to merge two of my passions; photography and soccer. The plan was to play soccer every time I saw a pick-up game, and then take a picture of the field. On a four month trip through Asia, the project began to have new meaning. I found that through mutual love soccer, I could connect with people of completely different brackgrounds, cultures and languages.</p>
                  <p>A few <a href="http://www.itsnicethat.com/articles/photography-austen-ezzell">blogs</a> and <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/features/portfolio-californian-austen-ezzell-spent-five-months-photographing-football-pitches-around-the-globe-for-his-project-the-worlds-game-9422072.html">newspapers</a> thought it was interesting enough to write about. I continue to play pick-up games and take pictures of soccer fields. </p>
